A spaceship's interior is being redesigned. All compartments are cuboid-shaped (meaning length, width, and height are all rectangular). The redesign project involves a relaxation lounge measuring --c1-- meters by --c2-- meters, a captain's quarters measuring --m1-- meters by --m2-- meters, an engine room measuring --s1-- meters by --s2-- meters, a docking bay measuring --l1-- meters by --l2-- meters, and a main bridge measuring --d1-- meters by --d2-- meters. The total internal volume of the spaceship is --Va-- cubic meters.  Two types of wall paneling are available: a sleek, metallic option and a plush, sound-dampening material. The metallic paneling costs --rw-- credits per square meter, while the sound-dampening material costs --rc-- credits per square meter.  The relaxation lounge, captain's quarters, and main bridge will be outfitted with sound-dampening panels for optimal comfort and communication. The docking bay and engine room will utilize the metallic panels for durability and ease of maintenance.  Paneling is done for only ceiling and flooring if whole room area is considered we should include all 4 walls too.
