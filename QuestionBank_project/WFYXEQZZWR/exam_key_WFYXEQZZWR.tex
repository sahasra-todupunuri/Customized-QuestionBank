A spaceship's interior is being redesigned. All compartments are cuboid-shaped (meaning length, width, and height are all rectangular). The redesign project involves a relaxation lounge measuring 12 meters by 12 meters, a captain's quarters measuring 6 meters by 8 meters, an engine room measuring 6 meters by 8 meters, a docking bay measuring 24 meters by 26 meters, and a main bridge measuring 30 meters by 44 meters. The total internal volume of the spaceship is 4364 cubic meters.  Two types of wall paneling are available: a sleek, metallic option and a plush, sound-dampening material. The metallic paneling costs 128 credits per square meter, while the sound-dampening material costs 260 credits per square meter.  The relaxation lounge, captain's quarters, and main bridge will be outfitted with sound-dampening panels for optimal comfort and communication. The docking bay and engine room will utilize the metallic panels for durability and ease of maintenance.  Paneling is done for only ceiling and flooring if whole room area is considered we should include all 4 walls too.
